\section*{Exercise 1:  Fixed point iteration \normalsize \textnormal(xx points)}

In this exercise, we wish to find $x^*$ satisfying $g(x^*) = x^*$. $x^*$ is a fixed point of $g$. Solving this system is equivalent to finding the roots of $g(x) - x$, but the system $g(x) = x$ suggests another potential method:\\
(1) Take an initial guess $x_0$.\\
(2) Iterate $x_k = g(x_{k-1})$ until $E_k = g(x_k) - x_k < \varepsilon$. 

\subsection{} Assuming $g$ is Lipschitz with constant $c$, show that this iteration converges if $0 \leq c < 1$. What is the convergence rate ?

\subsection{} Prove that if $g$ is Lipschitz with constant $0 \leq c < 1$ in a neighborhood $[x^* - \delta, x^* + \delta]$, then so long as $x_0$ is chosen in this interval, fixed point iteration will converge.

\subsection{} Suppose $g$ is differentiable with $g_0(x^*) = 0$. Show that in this case, the fixed point iteration has quadratic convergence.\newline
\newline
\emph{\textbf{Definition:} A function $f$ is Lipschitz continuous if there exists a constant $c$ such that $|f(x) - f(y)| \leq c|x - y|$.}

\section*{Exercise 2: Shape matching\normalsize \textnormal(xx points)}

Given two sets of points $\{{\bf x}_i\}_{i = 1\hdots n}$ and $\{{\bf y}_i\}_{i = 1\hdots n}$, we want to find the best rigid transformation that match the ${\bf x}_i$ to the points ${\bf y}_i$. We consider that the rigid transformation is composed of a translation of vector ${\bf t}$ and followed by a rotation of matrix ${\bf R}$.

\subsection{} Formulate the optimization problem for finding the best ${\bf t}$ and ${\bf R}$ in the least square sens. What are the constraints on ${\bf R}$ ?

\subsection{} Let's fix for know the matrix ${\bf R}$. Show that the optimal translation vector ${\bf t}$ is vector between the barycenters of the two sets of points.

\subsection{} We are now looking for the optimal rotation matrix ${\bf R}$. Propose a unconstraint minimization problem using Lagrange multiplier method. 
\subsection{} Find a system of equations verified by ${\bf R}$.

\subsection{} Considering the  matrix ${\bf R}$ (of dimension $3 \times 3$) as a vector ${\bf r}$ of dimension 9, re-write the equation of the previous question and propose an analytical solution for ${\bf r}$.
